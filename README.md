# Why do I want to make this?

The reason I want to make this Addon for the game is to make deciding which item is best for my character easier, which items should I consider using for my character to optimize the most damage possible, and to help others including myself choose what type of build and what items will suit my character the best for Dungeons, Raids, PvE and PvP. 

# What do I want to achieve with this? 

I want to be able to make an addon for WOW Classic/MOP which will help me identify when I collect an item, if its worth keeping or selling, what it will do for my character if it suits its class and specialization, and what it would be best for e.g. PvE or PvP.
